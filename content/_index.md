I am an assistant professor in the [Electrical and Computer Engineering Department](https://ece.byu.edu/) at [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/). My research is in robotic perception, mapping, and localization with a particular emphasis on field robotics in marine environments.  I run the [Field Robotic Systems Lab](https://frostlab.byu.edu/) at BYU and teach courses in Computer Systems and Robotics.

Welcome to my online notes vault. I plan to use this site to post thoughts/notes that may hopefully be useful both in terms of research and teaching.
