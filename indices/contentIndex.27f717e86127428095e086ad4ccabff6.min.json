My research is in robotic perception, mapping, and localization with a particular emphasis on field robotics in marine environments.  I run the [Field Robotic Systems Lab](https://frostlab.byu.edu/) at BYU and teach courses in Computer Systems and Robotics.\n\nWelcome to my online notes vault. I plan to use this site to post thoughts/notes that may hopefully be useful both in terms of research and teaching. \n\n# Some Relevant Notes\n[[public/Factor Graph|What is a Factor Graph?]]\n\n","lastmodified":"2022-06-04T18:34:28.624355282Z","tags":null},"/public/Bipartite-Graph":{"title":"Bipartite Graph","content":"\n# Definition: Bipartite Graph\nIn graph theory a *bipartite graph* is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets $U$ and $V$. In other words, every edge in the graph connects a vertex in $U$ to a vertex in $V$.\n\n## References \n1.
